# PersonalProjects
This is a collection of personal projects I work on my off time

So far I am only working on a chatbot
this was mainly for me to increase my coding capabilities in Python
Hopefully by spending a minimum of an hour each day working on it, I'll be able to really boost my confidence levels.

Go ahead and take a look at it and if you have any offered feedback/suggestions/comments/concerns I'm all eyes!

(UPDATE 29 January 2024) <br>
I have poked and prodded throughout my repository here but have since committed this year to actually provide updates within my repo atleast 2x per month. Here's to hoping that I stick to it. I have since put my chat bot on the back burner as it is to the point without utilizing any API to make it more responsive or I need to learn more advanced techniques with Python to get it to a more perfunctory state. Right now I am still working on my BA in Applied Computing and will be actively working on a website design for a class project as well as my personal website through learning REACT and managing the Data Science Clubs as co-president.
