# PersonalProjects
This is a collection of personal projects I work on my off time

So far I am only working on a chatbot
this was mainly for me to increase my coding capabilities in Python
Hopefully by spending a minimum of an hour each day working on it, I'll be able to really boost my confidence levels.

Go ahead and take a look at it and if you have any offered feedback/suggestions/comments/concerns I'm all eyes!
